# Environment variables for hardik_rent_backend
#
# IMPORTANT: Replace placeholder values with your actual credentials.
# In a production environment like Render, you will set these directly in the Render dashboard.

# Firebase Service Account Key: Paste the entire JSON content of your Firebase service account key file here,
# ensuring it's a single line or properly escaped if multiline.
# Example: FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY='{"type": "service_account", "project_id": "your-project-id", ...}'
FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY=your_firebase_service_account_json_here

# Port for the backend server to listen on.
# Render automatically sets a PORT environment variable, so this might not be strictly necessary
# if your app uses process.env.PORT. However, it's good practice to define for local development.
PORT=3000

# Your Firebase Project ID
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_firebase_project_id_here

# Razorpay API Key ID
RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=your_razorpay_key_id_here

# Razorpay API Key Secret
RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET=your_razorpay_key_secret_here

# Note: FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_PATH is used for local file-based service account loading.
# For Render, it's recommended to use FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY directly.
# FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_PATH=./path/to/your/serviceAccountKey.json
